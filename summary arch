Storage arch 
parquet/orc :column based efficient for reading specfic columns and high compression
acro : row based

Best use case :
parquet : data lakes spark olap readheavy workloads 
ORC : hive/hadoop ecosystem , highly compressed data storage 
avro : kafka streaming data ETL, write heavy workloads, schema evolution 

Compression & perf 
Orc generally offers the highest compression , reduce storage costs
parquet excels in query perf on large datasets
avro has moderate compression but is fast for writing and serialization.
schema evolution 
avro is the most flexible , allowing changes to the data structures
parquet supports it but is less flexible than avro. 
ORC has limited schema evolution capabilities

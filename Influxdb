simple querying 
while almost any graph query could be performed on a relational database using SQL, the query would be extremely complex. most graph databases have query languages built around the 
idea of working with edges and nodes and traversing a graph structure. the result is simpler queries the are faster to write and easier to understand.

standard SQL versus cypher query language used with neo4j

SQL 

Select e.lastname, et.Description
FROM employee AS e
JOIN employeeTerritory AS et ON (et.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID)
JOIN Territory AS t ON (et.TerritoryID = t.TerritoryID);
copy 

cypher

Match (t:Territory)<-[:IN_territory]-(e:Employee)
RETURN t.description,collect(e.lastname);
copy

Joins are very exp in terms of performance, trying to join values between many tables will result in very slow queries for large data sets.
In comparision, these type of queries using graph database will be fast even on a large scale.

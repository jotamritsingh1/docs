Ecosystem & Integration: deltalake is optimised for spark/databricks. Iceberg is designed for multi-engine,open data stack.
schema and partioning: iceberg supports full schema evolution and hidden partitioning, which simplefies management by not requiring manual column updates or partitioning changes.
delta lake supports schema changes but can struggle with complex changes.
performance: Iceberg is generally better for high-volume batch processing and read heavy workloads. delta lake is often faster for streaming , though both are competitive.
file formats: iceberg supports parquet,ORC, and avro, delta lake primarily supports parquet.
interoperability : delta lake has introduced delta uniform to alow for better compatibility wth tools that support iceberg.

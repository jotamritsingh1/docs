Apache avro : designed for write intensive scenario and data serialization.
  excellent schema evolution , compact binary format , but slower for analytical queries 

Apache parquet : optimised for read-heavy analytical workloads (spark/presto).High compression ratios and efficient columnar storage

Apache iceberg (table Format /management layer) : manages collections of files (usually parquet) to provide ACID transactions , time travel , robust partitoning.
  It solves the performance limitations of listing files in data lakes.

  
comparison 
avro for rawdata ingestion , CDC (change data capture),and streaming applications. use parquet for long term storage of analytics data where query perf is critical.
  use iceberg to manage large scale data lakes where you need ACID guarantees, time travel or partition evolution
typical data lake house arch , ingest data in avro , convert to parquet for storage ,and manage file using iceberg for quering.

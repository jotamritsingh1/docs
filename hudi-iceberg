Hudi excels in CDC (change data capture) and near realtime workloads (e.g streaming). Iceberg is generally better for large-scale batch processing ans SQL analytics

Write/update perfomance: hudi supports merge on read(MoR), which allows faster writes by delaying data compaction,making it superior for high frequency updates.
  Iceberg is generally better for large scale batch processing and SQL analytics.
  
Architecture & features: hudi maintains indexing for efficient record lookup. iceberg shines with hidden partitioning and robust schema evolution(e.g,renaming/reordering columns) 
without rewriting data.
  
Ecosystem: Iceberg is highly engine agnostic (works well with Trino,Spark,Flink,Snowflake).hudi has strong integrations,particularly with spark,and offers its own ingestion tool(deltastreamer)
